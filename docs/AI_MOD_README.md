## 🧠 How It Works

### Mob AI System

1. **State Assessment** - Mob analyzes:
   - Health (self and target)
   - Distance to target
   - Environmental factors (terrain, time, biome)
   - Nearby allies

2. **Action Selection** - AI chooses best action using:
   - Rule-based decision trees
   - Success/failure tracking
   - Weighted probability

3. **Learning** - Mobs improve over time:
   - Track which actions succeed
   - Adjust behavior based on outcomes
   - Adapt to player strategies

### Villager Dialogue System

1. **Context Gathering**:
   - Player name and relationship
   - Current situation
   - Recent interactions
   - Time and location

2. **Personality Application**:
   - Select dominant trait
   - Apply mood modifiers
   - Choose appropriate templates

3. **Generation**:
   - Fill in context variables
   - Add personality flavor
   - Include mood indicators

4. **Learning**:
   - Track successful dialogue
   - Evolve personality over time
   - Remember preferences
