# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Rename output jar to `Adaptive-Mob-Ai-Fabric-<version>.jar` to avoid mixing it up with Forge/legacy builds.
- Update docs to reference the Fabric jar name.
- Add Fabric dependencies as `compileOnly` for better IDE/static analysis resolution.
- Fix federated download parsing to tolerate backend schema variants (prevents "Missing tactics field" rejections).

## 1.0.0

- Initial Fabric release.
